# Refactor Tractor
In this group project, we refactored a pre-existing codebase to use SASS, Fetch, jQuery, and Webpack. We also edited an existing testing system in order to use chai spies to spy on DOM manipulation methods that were being referenced in class methods. We separated the data and presentation logic using a domUpdates.js file that held all of our DOM manipulation methods. 

FitLit is an activity tracker that allows users to track their hydration, activity, steps, and sleep. The app allows users to see their data via a dashboard, where they can also compare their progress to that of their friends. 

## Install/Setup
In order to use this codebase, please fork the repo and then run `git clone` to clone the repo to a remote repository. After you've cloned the repo and are inside of the repo, you can run `npm install` to download all necessary dependencies. 

Next, you can run `npm start` in the terminal to access the server. You can then read the ensuing message in order to view a link at which you can access the website. You can copy this link into your browser and view the project.

If you would like to make changes and submit a pull request, you can run `npm start` in a separate tab in the terminal so that you do not need to constantly run `npm start` after making changes.  

## Goals and Objectives
When completing this project, we had the following goals:
- To build on top of and navigate a pre-existing codebase
- To develop processes for working remotely and submitting pull requests
- To make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data
- To refactor pre-existing code and use inheritance to DRY up repetitive logic
- To ensure app is following best practices for accessibility
- To detect cross-browser compatibility issues by testing the app on different platforms and environments
- To learn how to use jQuery
- To implement SASS
- To incorporate Webpack in order to streamline the workflow process
- To leverage chai spies to verify that DOM manipulation methods were successfully being invoked during testing
