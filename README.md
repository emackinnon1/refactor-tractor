# Refactor Tractor
In this group project, we built on top of somebody else’s pre-existing FitLit codebase. FitLit is an activity tracker for many users over many days. The app logs data and presents it on a dashboard for users to view and see their latest activity data, goals, and milestones.

## Goals and Objectives
- Build on top of pre-existing code that we did not write and navigate someone else’s codebase
- Develop processes for working remotely and submitting pull requests to perform effective code reviews that help ensure the code is accurate and that everyone understands it
- Make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data
- Refactor pre-existing code and use inheritance to DRY up repetitive logic
- Ensure app is following best practices for accessibility
- Detect cross-browser compatibility issues by testing your app on different platforms and environments
- Practice understanding of DOM manipulation with jQuery
- Leverage Sass to DRY up CSS
- Incorporate Webpack to streamline workflow process
- Leverage Chai Spies to verify that DOM manipulation is happening
